**game.ts is a lightweight, developer-friendly engine designed for seamless game development.**

Built upon the robust foundations of raylib, it provides a sophisticated Object-Oriented architectural pattern, empowering developers with rapid prototyping capabilities and highly modular tools.

> **Note:** This engine is currently **under heavy development**. It is not yet feature-complete and will be officially available soon.

Basic Example
--------------
This minimal example demonstrates how to initialize a scene and instantiate an actor.

```typescript
import { Game, Actor, Scene, Director } from "game.ts"

export class Example extends Game {
    public override onStart(): void {
        const director = this.modules.director as Director;
        const mainScene = new Scene({ parent: director, name: "MainScene" });
        
        // Actors are automatically managed by the scene lifecycle
        new Actor({ parent: mainScene, name: "MyActor" });
        
        director.switchCurrentScene("MainScene");
    }
}

const game = new Example({ parent: null, name: "Example" });
game.start();
